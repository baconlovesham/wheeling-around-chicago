							<h2>Chicago is expericing a cycling surge</h2>
                            <b>There is a greater adoption of cycling as a form of transport</b>
                            <p>Since the 1980s, the number of cyclist commuters has grown by 12x (Active Transportation Alliance 2020)</p>
                            <b>Bike sharing culture is only expected to grow</b>
                            <p>Divvy hit a record high of more than 5.6 million bike trips in 2022, over 60% higher than 2019 (City of Chicago 2023)</p>
                            <b>Chicago city is committed to a cycling strategy</b>
                            <p>The city is committing over $17m to expand Chicago’s bike network. Divvy is adding 3,000 new bikes and 250 stations by 2025 (City of Chicago 2023).</p>
                            
                            <h2>There is rising interest in cycling/ bike sharing as a form of urban transport </h2>
                            <p>This is fuelled in three areas:</p>
                            <b>Limitations of automobile-dependent transport planning</b>
							<p>Cities that are dependent on automobile as a form of urban transport often are faced with parking problems, air pollution, reduced amenities, livability and climate change issues (Hickman &amp; Banister 2014). Cycling on the other hand, enables urban mobility without producing these negative externalities.</p>
							
                            <b>Rapid growth in bike sharing services mainstreaming the use of cycling as urban transport</b>
                            <p>Today, more than 850 cities worldwide have bike sharing programs. From a consumer perspective, the availability, affordability and convenience of service supported by technological advancements have made bike sharing a viable, if not, economical option.</p>
                            
                            <b>Big data on cycling patterns now available</b>
                            <p>Previously, data on cycling patterns was deficient as data on cyclists and their trips were not readily collected. However with GPS technologies, live point data and journey data now  collected by bike sharing companies, the data gap is now filled.</p>
                            
                            <h2 style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Yet, despite cycling's benefits, studies have also raised questions about the equitability of cycling as a form of transport</h2>
